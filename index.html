    <h1> Man jumps at Fed. Court Judge in Las Vegas after being sentenced</h1>
    <p>  The incident last week unfolded Wednesday after Redden and his attorney asked the judge for <b>probation</b> rather than time behind bars, saying the 30-year-old is getting his life back on track with a new job and plans to resume his education. Seconds later, Redden shouted, <b>“F**k that b*tch!”</b> and ran toward the judge, leaping over the bench and attacking her. Redden tackled Holthus to the ground, and both disappeared from the cameras view behind the bench, the video shows.
